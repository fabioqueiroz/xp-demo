# XP Agile Demo

## Info

This is a tiny project that contains a .NET 5.0 WebAPI and a single frontend React page
used as an example of how the XP Scrum technique could improve  productivity within a 
development team currently working implementing the standard Scrum.

The project was also aimed to demonstrate to more junior developers how to design a DDD-oriented
microservice using the industry and framework best practices, including unit tests using xUnit.
